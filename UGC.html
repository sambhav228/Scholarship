<p><h3>U.G.C SCHOLARSHIPS</h3></p>
<p>First of all U.G.C means "UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMISSION".it is a quality higher education for all.</p>
<p><h3>ABOUT U.G.C</h3></p>
<p>The University Grants Commission (UGC) came into existence on 28th December, 1953 and became a statutory Organization of the Government of India by an Act of Parliament in 1956, for the coordination,determination and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and research in university education.
<p>In 1952, the Union Government decided that all cases pertaining to the allocation of grants-in-aid from public funds to the Central Universities and other Universities and Institutions of higher learning might be referred to the University Grants Commission. Consequently, the University Grants Commission (UGC) was formally inaugurated by late Shri Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the then Minister of Education, Natural Resources and Scientific Research on 28 December 1953.</p>
<p>The UGC, however, was formally established only in November 1956 as a statutory body of the Government of India through an Act of Parliament for the coordination, determination and maintenance of standards of university education in India. In order to ensure effective region-wise coverage throughout the country, the UGC has decentralised its operations by setting up six regional centres at Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bhopal, Guwahati and Bangalore. The head office of the UGC is located at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in New Delhi, with two additional bureaus operating from 35, Feroze Shah Road and the South Campus of University of Delhi as well.</p>
<p><h3>MANDATE OF U.G.C</h3></p>
<p>The UGC has the unique distinction of being the only grant-giving agency in the country which has been vested with two responsibilities: that of providing funds and that of coordination, determination and maintenance of standards in institutions of higher education.

The UGC`s mandate includes: <br>


Promoting and coordinating university education.<br>

Determining and maintaining standards of teaching, examination and research in universities.<br>

Framing regulations on minimum standards of education.<br>

Monitoring developments in the field of collegiate and university education; disbursing grants to the universities and colleges.<br>
